# along with the body of your message (but it erases all the headers generated
# when replying).
#set edit_headers=yes

# and allow you to immediately begin editing the body of your message. The send-menu 
# may still be accessed once you have finished editing the body of your message.
#set autoedit=yes

# When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped when 
# replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is skipped when forwarding
# messages, but then it is all blank and has to be filled in by hand.
