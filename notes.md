# *Open Sources* Book

Clearly this was an effort put together by the OS folks as they launched (1998) their agenda to supplant FS with OS.  They hold to the ideology that the open source method produces better software, full stop.  [The argument here is essentially that of the scientific method: open sharing of data/results is central to the progress of science.]  OS has nothing at all to do with changing society, with being "political."  They object to proprietary software not because property is morally/ethically/politically bad, because it alienates us from each other and from the product of our labor, because it produces massive inequalities in society.  No.  It is bad because it inhibits the technical progress of software.

RMS is seen by them to be "ideological," as writing "manifestos," as a "purist".  They are the apolitical pragmatists who only care about good code.  They are not only willing to work with corporations in pursuit of profit, *that is their preferred method*.  In many cases, OSers *are* corporations (Red Hat, Netscape,  They want to get away from the idea that OS is produced by hobbyists, and make it a "legitimate" enterprise produced by coders (sorry, "software engineers") working in large corporations like IBM, HP, Digital, Sun, etc.  They want to get away, too, from the idea that this is in *any* way a political movement, an attempt to change the structure of society.  Liberal capitalism is absolutely fine with them (and State Socialism is a bad economic model).  They only want to make the claim that corporate capitalist software production has been using an ineffective development method, that OS will produce better software than proprietary.

Stallman, bless his heart, agreed to be a part of the book, even though its central purpose was to retire FS in favor of OS.  He is quite clearly trying to fundamentally change society, to move from a proprietary society in which we are separated from each other to a cooperative society in which we share with our neighbor.  This is modeled on how "hackers" operated in the early 70s to produce software, but Stallman clearly favors an extension of this kind of community to our communities more generally.  He thinks proprietary corporate software may or may not produce a better project, but it necessarily produces a worse society.  Proprietary relations
*alienate coders from the software they produce
*alienate coders/users from each other
*create relations in which owners (corporations) have power over non-owners (coders/users)

communism

The limits of RMS are that
*he is a bit of a grating personality
*his political theory is underdeveloped (hidden?)
*his development model *is* cathedral rather than bazaar. This may just be because he did all his best work (emacs, gcc, utilities) before the internet and microcomputers-for-everyone, and so recruiting a large team of volunteer developers and users to help debug, as the bazaar model requires, was much harder before 1993.
